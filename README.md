Chronic kidney disease is one of the most common diseases facing humans, as well as one of the most dangerous. 
This disease is defined as a long-term condition in which the kidneys do not work as they should. It is a common condition often associated with aging.
It can infect anyone, but it is more common in most countries such as those in South Asia. We come to the role that we have worked on now. 
Here in this project, we used data containing features for reasons that indicate chronic kidney disease. We played an important role in this, which is that we used machine learning algorithms to help classify the person with or without this disease. . Where the results we obtained showed that they are wonderful results, and the measurements proved that.


# Show the problem
At the present time, there are many types of diseases, as they have become widely spread, 
and if the condition progresses, this negatively affects the affected person, and here we have a kind of serious disease, 
which is chronic moxibustion, as this type of leprosy has become very widespread and has increased the threat of deaths for those infected with that disease 
in the period Last.


# Provided solution
Here we have proposed a solution that is considered one of the most important solutions, which is the most popular solution that is presented now, 
and it is the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to solve this problem by detecting the disease early and in its first stage, 
as it makes the patient take the appropriate treatment in the early time so that it does not develop The disease is terminal and affects greatly and develops.


# The results we obtained 
In this project, the best modified machine learning algorithms were used and applied according to the shape of the data and appropriate to it, which extracted a lower value, a lower rate of error, and a higher testing and training rate. 
Where the `model_DT Train Score was obtained in the training is : 0.95625` and `model_DT Test Score is : 0.9125` 
These results are very good and good as it is for the `DecisionTreeClassifier` 
model and this is one of the best models that give accurate and effective solutions.
